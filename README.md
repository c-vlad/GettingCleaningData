This repository contains the scripts required for the course project of the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera class.

The included files are:

- *README.md*, this file
- *CodeBook.md*, describing the variables, data and the transformations performed on them
- *run_analysis.R*, the script which generates the two required output datasets (as described in the file CodeBook.md)
- *mean_std_features.zip*, first required dataset (measurements on the mean and standard deviation), compressed
- *mean_std_features.mean_by_subject_activity.txt*, second required dataset (obtained from the previous one by averaging each variable by subject and activity)
